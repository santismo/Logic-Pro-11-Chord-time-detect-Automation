Updates
---------

- better chord analysis and detection/less misidentification 
- bass note chord classification preference
- slash chords optional
- single notes dismissed
- arpeggios/rolled/raked chords permitted

New Release
----------
✅ global chord track implementation
  
(further documentation coming, current working shortcut available in files)

^Necccasary Key commands:

Shift C, create chord

Ctrl opt E, edit chord

Z, go to position 

- Remember to setup chord track automation to hotkey combo of your choosing after download and instal.

Also, I found some interesting chord meta event data numeric 103, which turns normal midi regions into midi chord regions dragable to chord track.
Don't know how to exploit it though... 🤷‍♂️

In Development
--------------
- better complex chord determination
- audio to midi analysis expansion
- possible plug-in finished product
- :)
